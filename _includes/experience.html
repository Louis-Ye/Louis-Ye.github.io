### Software Engineer Intern, Google 
<h5> Sunnyvale, CA <span class="float-right">May 2018 - Aug 2018</span> </h5>
* Worked at the Google-Wide Profiling Team under Google Cloud.
* (Open-Source) Implemented a functions tracing feature in the popular VM-style binary executable instrumentation framework written in C/C++.
* Implemented a C/C++ allocations and memory access analysis tool that helps in improving data structures code for better CPU cache usage and LLC hit rate.
* Implemented C++ helper libraries for emulating and recording heap objects access behaviors.
* Implemented C++ helper libraries for translating binary run-time data by leveraging DWARF format content in the cloud-based RPC-Style build system context.
* (Open-Source) Fixed bugs on the re-attach scenario in the binary instrumentation framework written in C.


### Software Engineer Intern, Microsoft 
<h5> Vancouver, BC <span class="float-right">Jan 2018 - Apr 2018</span> </h5>
* Designed and implemented the backend leaderboard service for a multi-million-user game. The service is built upon highly scalable distributed computing units, distributed message-passing technologies and high-performance in-memory database (Service Fabric, Azure Service Bus, Redis), and it aims to scale to hundreds of leaderboards with each having millions of users and supporting almost-real-time updates.
* Profiled and analyzed the performance of the micro-services system to identify performance bottlenecks, implemented the corresponding patches to batch requests correctly to reduce the number of transactions.
* Worked with the team in another department to fix high-priority resources spamming bug.


### Research Assistant, Computer Systems Labs 
<h5> University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC <span class="float-right">Sep 2016 - Present</span> </h5>
* Research focuses on automating the process of root causes identification of performance problems in multi-threaded applications (e.g., inefficient traversals, synchronization bottlenecks, etc.).
* Developed tools adopting runtime tracing and LLVM to analyze functions calls, allocations and memory accesses for identifying causes of performance problems on a backend storage engine.


### Software Developer Intern, Activision Blizzard, Demonware
<h5> Vancouver, BC <span class="float-right">Sep - Dec 2015</span> </h5>
* Proposed & implemented a distributed cache framework (investigated the existing architecture, wrote a technical design, defensed it against 10+ full-time developers from all levels, implemented it) for a multi-player game service (mostly written in Python). The framework can reflect the latest value immediately after write requests while providing great performance for a large number of read requests (millions of requests per second).
* Designed and implemented a pseudo multi-threaded automation script for analyzing errors in distributed server logs.
* Discovered and fixed database ACID violations bugs in backend RESTful APIs.


### Research Assistant, Multicore Systems and Parallel Computing Lab
<h5>Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, BC <span class="float-right">Jan - Aug 2015</span></h5>
* Built special data structures and a task-stealing scheduler for a lock-free programming framework to efficiently solve synchronization problems that caused by holding many locks in multi-threaded programs.


### Software Developer Intern, BlackBerry
<h5>Mississauga, ON  <span class="float-right">May - Aug 2014</span> </h5>
* Designed and developed automation scripting tools for software development and branches integration.
* Implemented features of IP Multimedia Subsystem, written in C++, in BlackBerry OS 10.


### Teaching Assistant of Operating Systems Course (CPEN 331)
<h5> University of British Columbia  <span class="float-right">Sep - Dec 2017</span> </h5>
* Assisting students to hack an OS kernel written in C, which is runnable on MIPS architecture


### Group leader of research trip to information technology companies
<h5> Tencent (Shenzhen, China) and Huawei (Hangzhou, China) <span class="float-right">Jul 2013 â€“ Aug 2014</span> </h5>
* Presented research on operational and technical details of Tencent and Huawei.
* Received the second prize in Summer Research Trip Program of Zhejiang University.


### Student Leader of Dual Degree Program (DDP) of ZJU and SFU
<h5>Zhejiang University and Simon Fraser University <span class="float-right">Aug 2011 - May 2016</span> </h5>
* Organized activities for international students in the program.
