    I am Louis Ye 叶绿宇 (or Lvyu Ye, or Lyuyu Ye), a systems guy ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°). I care about performance profiling, CPU architecture, compilers, operating systems, distributed systems, debugging tools, just to name a few.

    Currently, I am a full-time software engineer at Google. I received a thesis-based master's degree from the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department of UBC (University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada). I hold two bachelor's degrees: one from the Computer Science Department of SFU (Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, BC, Canada) and the other from the Computer Science Department of 浙江大学 (Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China).
