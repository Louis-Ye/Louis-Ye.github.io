## Professional

### Software Developer Intern, Demonware (subsidiary of Activision Blizzard)
<h5> Vancouver, BC <p class="right-align">Sep-Dec 2015</p> </h5>
* Proposed & implemented a distributed cache framework (investigated the existing architecture, wrote a technical design, defensed it against 10+ full-time developers from all levels, implemented it) for a multi-player game service (mostly written in Python). The framework can reflect the latest value immediately after write requests while providing great performance for a large number of read requests (millions of requests per second).
* Designed and implemented a pseudo multi-threaded automation script for analyzing errors in distributed server logs.
* Discovered and fixed database ACID violations bugs in backend RESTful APIs.
