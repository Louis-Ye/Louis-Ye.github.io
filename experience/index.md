## Professional

### Software Developer Intern
##### Demonware (subsidiary of Activision Blizzard), Vancouver, BC, Sep-Dec 2015
* Proposed a distributed cache framework (investigated the existing architecture, wrote a design document, defensed it against 10+ full-time developers from all levels), and implemented it for a multi-player game service (mostly written in Python). By replacing a stale cache framework, the new framework can reflect the latest value immediately after write requests while providing great performance for a large number of read requests (millions of requests per second).
* Designed and implemented a pseudo multi-threaded automation script for analyzing errors in distributed server logs.
* Discovered and fixed database ACID violations bugs in backend RESTful APIs.

### Software Developer Intern
##### BlackBerry, Mississauga, ON, May-Aug 2014
* Designed and developed automation scripting tools for software development and branches integration.
* Implemented features of IP Multimedia Subsystem, written in C++, in BlackBerry OS 10.

## Research

### Research Assistant
##### Computer Systems Labs, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Sep 2016 - Present
* Research focuses on automating the process of root causes identification of performance problems in multi-threaded applications (e.g., inefficient traversals, synchronization bottlenecks, etc.).
* Developed tools adopting runtime tracing and LLVM to analyze functions calls, allocations and memory accesses for identifying causes of performance problems on a backend storage engine.

### Research Assistant
##### Multicore Systems and Parallel Computing Lab, Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, BC, Jan-Aug 2015
* Built special data structures and a task-stealing scheduler for a lock-free programming framework to efficiently solve synchronization problems that caused by holding many locks in multi-threaded programs.
