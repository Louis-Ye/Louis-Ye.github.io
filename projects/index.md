### Emulator of Disaggregated Data Center (DDC)
<h5> University of British Columbia <p class="right-align"><i>(Private Repo)</i> Sep - Dec 2017</p></h5>
* Collaboratively building a distributed system that simulates DDC network environment on normal clusters.
* Hacking the OS network stack to minimize the CPU-to-remote-memory latency.

<h3> <a href="https://dinamite-toolkit.github.io/">DINAMITE – A Dynamic Tracing Tool Using LLVM</a></h3>
<h5>University of British Columbia <p class="right-align"> Sep 2016 – May 2017</p></h5>
* Workd on an extended LLVM pass, a compiler frontend written in C++, to instrument functions and memory accesses.
* Made use of distributed IDs generation and dynamic programming to accelerate compilation of instrumented programs.

### OS161 kernel – An OS kernel running on MIPS architecture
<h5> University of British Columbia <p class="right-align"><i>(Private Repo)</i> Jan - May 2017</p></h5>
* Hacked OS161, a real OS kernel written in C, to implement virtual memory system, processes management system, and file IO system calls, which consist of memory core map, page tables, TLB management, PIDs management, etc.

<h3><a href="https://github.com/fontify">Fontify – A tool for converting handwriting picture into digital font </a></h3>
<h5> Hackathon nwHacks <p class="right-align">Feb 2016</p></h5>
* Collaboratively built a full-stack web-server app with Flask, a Python backend framework, in 24 hours. The app pipelines processes of user interaction, image distortion, and scalable vector graphics conversion to generate the digital font.

### Analysis of relationships between power efficiency and CPU/GPU frequencies
<h5> University of British Columbia <p class="right-align"><i>(Private Repo)</i> Sep – Dec 2016</p></h5>
* Designed and implemented empirical experiments to analyze the influence of processors frequency to power efficiency on Jetson TK1 and TX1 platforms (system-on-a-chip architecture).
* Implemented the workload with CUDA to process irregular applications (graph algorithms).

<hr>

### Sensors and Clusters Monitoring System
<h5> Computer Network Lab, Simon Fraser University <p class="right-align"><i>(Private Repo)</i> May - Oct, 2015</p></h5>
* Built a backend system written in Ruby and Ruby on Rails for monitoring current and historical usages of a large computers cluster.

<hr>

### Crash-recoverable Distributed File System
<h5> Simon Fraser University <p class="right-align"><i>(Private Repo)</i> Jan - May 2015</p></h5>
* Built a C++ written file system with replicas to ensure high availability in the scenario of node’s crash, and a write-ahead-logging mechanism to ensure the correctness of random failure recovery.

<hr>

### Natural Language Processor
<h5> Simon Fraser University <p class="right-align"><i>(Private Repo)</i> Sep - Dec 2014</p></h5>
* Collaboratively built an NLP project.
* Built segmenting feature to translate none-segmented language written in hieroglyphic, translating feature based on big-data set and machine learning algorithm, and reranking feature to select better translation results.

<hr>

### Towhee – Compiler
<h5> Simon Fraser University <p class="right-align"><i>(Private Repo)</i> Sep - Dec 2014</p></h5>
* Built a compiler for Towhee, a strong-type object-oriented programming language, in more than more than 10,000 lines of Java Code.
* Built explicitly and implicitly releasing (similar to garbage collection) mechanism.
* Built feature to transfer the towhee program into ASM-like intermediate codes.

<h3><a href="https://github.com/Louis-Ye/Logo-470">Express LOGO</a></h3>
<h5> Simon Fraser University <p class="right-align">Jan–Apr 2014</p></h5>
* LOGO programming language website. Providing online LOGO interpreter, tutorial, documentation.
* Developed with Angular.js, Express JS, Bootstrap. Using JavaScript, HTML5.
* Implemented a LOGO translator with pure JavaScript

<hr>

<h3><a href="https://github.com/Louis-Ye/FibonacciHeap">Fibonacci Heap Library in C++</a></h3>
<h5> Personal Project <p class="right-align">Sep - Dec 2013</p></h5>
* Built an open source Fibonacci Heap (a special data structure) library.
* Made the corresponding APIs similar to C++ standard STL library.
* Made the operations of inserting, decreasing and minimum finding cost O(1) amortized time.
