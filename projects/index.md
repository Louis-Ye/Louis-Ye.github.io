### DINAMITE – A Dynamic Tracing Tool Using LLVM
##### University of British Columbia, Sep 2016 – May 2017
* Extended LLVM, a compiler frontend written in C++, to instrument functions and memory accesses.
* Made use of distributed IDs generation and dynamic programming to accelerate compilation of instrumented programs.


### OS161 kernel – An OS kernel running on MIPS architecture 
##### University of British Columbia, Jan 2017 – May 2017
* Hacked OS161, a real OS kernel written in C, to implement virtual memory system, processes management system, and file IO system calls, which consist of memory core map, page tables, TLB management, PIDs management, etc.


### Fontify – A tool for converting handwriting picture into digital font 
##### Hackathon nwHacks, Feb, 2016
* Collaboratively built a full-stack web-server app with Flask, a Python backend framework, in 24 hours. The app pipelines processes of user interaction, image distortion, and scalable vector graphics conversion to generate the digital font.


### Analysis of relationships between power efficiency and CPU/GPU frequencies
##### University of British Columbia, Sep 2016 – Dec 2016
* Designed and implemented empirical experiments to analyze the influence of processors frequency to power efficiency on Jetson TK1 & TX1 platforms (system-on-a-chip architecture).
* Implemented the workload with CUDA to process irregular applications (graph algorithms).


### Sensors & Clusters Monitoring System
##### Computer Network Lab, Simon Fraser University, May-Oct, 2015
* Built a backend system written in Ruby and Ruby on Rails for monitoring current and historical usages of a large computers cluster.


### Crash-recoverable Distributed File System
##### Simon Fraser University, Jan 2015 – May 2015
* Built a C++ written file system with replicas to ensure high availability in the scenario of node’s crash, and a write-ahead-logging mechanism to ensure the correctness of random failure recovery.


### Natural Language Processor
##### Simon Fraser University, Sep-Dec 2014
* Collaboratively built an NLP project.
* Built segmenting feature to translate none-segmented language written in hieroglyphic, translating feature based on big-data set and machine learning algorithm, and reranking feature to select better translation results.


### Towhee – Compiler
##### Simon Fraser University, Sep-Dec 2014
* Built a compiler for Towhee, a strong-type object-oriented programming language, in more than more than 10,000 lines of Java Code.
* Built explicitly and implicitly releasing (similar to garbage collection) mechanism.
* Built feature to transfer the towhee program into ASM-like intermediate codes.


### Express LOGO
##### Simon Fraser University, Mar 2014 – Apr 2014
* LOGO programming language website. Providing online LOGO interpreter, tutorial, documentation.
* Developed with Angular.js, Express JS, Bootstrap. Using JavaScript, HTML5.
* Implemented a LOGO translator with pure JavaScript


### Fibonacci Heap Library in C++
##### Personal Project, Sep-Dec 2013
* Built an open source Fibonacci Heap (a special data structure) library.
* Made the corresponding APIs similar to C++ standard STL library.
* Made the operations of inserting, decreasing and minimum finding cost O(1) amortized time.


### Zhe Nar Navigation App
##### Zhejiang University, May 2013 – Jun 2013
* Collaboratively Built a campus navigation app with Objective-C and Python(Django).
* The app runs on both iOS and web platforms.
* The app helps students navigate through Zhejiang university and keeps up with the latest campus events. 


### CuTe Crazy Stone - a 2D team play strategy game
##### Sep 2012 – Jan 2013
* Collaboratively built the game with C++, the physical engine Box2D, and the graphic library QT.
